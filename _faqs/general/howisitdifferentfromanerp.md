Ecgnie is not an ERP. It is a platform that can have all features of ERP by installing required packages. As of now we have provided packages for "Accounting" module. More packages are in development that will bring all features of ERP to our users.

Ecgine allowes users to make own Packages and customizations which are not easily possible in big ERP software.
